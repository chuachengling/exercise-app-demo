# User Story: 8 - Generate Custom Exercise Routines with AI

**As a** user,
**I want** to request custom exercise routines using natural language descriptions,
**so that** I can get personalized workouts that match my specific needs and time constraints.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Users can input text descriptions of their desired workout (e.g., "30-minute exercise, first 15 minutes strength, next 15 minutes cardio")
* AI generates a custom exercise routine based on the description
* Generated routine includes specific exercises, durations, and instructions
* Users can save generated routines for future use
* Generated routines can be started immediately like pre-built exercise sets
* Requires internet connection for AI generation, but saved routines work offline

## Notes

* Uses AI (ChatGPT or local LLaMA model) for exercise generation
* Provides flexibility beyond pre-built exercise sets
* Example from transcript: user wants mixed strength and cardio workout with specific timing
