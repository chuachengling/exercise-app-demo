# User Story: 1 - Set Health Goals During Signup

**As a** new user,
**I want** to choose my health goal during the signup process (lose weight, gain muscle, train for competition, or general health tracking),
**so that** the app can personalize my experience and provide relevant recommendations.

## Acceptance Criteria

* During signup, users are presented with goal options: lose weight, gain muscle, train for competition, general health tracking
* Users must select at least one goal before proceeding
* The selected goal is stored and used to customize the user's dashboard and recommendations
* Users can modify their goals later in their profile settings

## Notes

* This foundational story enables personalization throughout the app
* Goals should influence what content and features are prioritized in the user interface
